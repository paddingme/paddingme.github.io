The <a href="http://www.javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=127624" title="The Java Posse - Episode 80">latest episode</a> of the Java Posse, the premier podcast for all things Java, mentions the recent <a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2006/08/22/grails-ejb3-article-on-infoq/">Grails + EJB3 article</a> on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/grails-ejb-tutorial">InfoQ</a>.&nbsp; It&#39;s Episode&nbsp;80, and you can hear what they have to say in the <em>Quick News</em> items at about the 43:25 mark. <blockquote><font>InfoQ has a detailed article on using the Grails framework,which is a Groovy-based alternative to Ruby on Rails, to access EJB3 domain components (or domain objects).&nbsp; All the way from entity objects over to back-end database tables through to a fully-working web user interface. It&#39;s a long article, but if you&#39;re interested in seeing what Grails is all about, it&#39;s, I think, the most complete Grails tutorial I&#39;ve seen yet, and nicely covers the domain of integrating Grails with an enterprise system.</font></blockquote> <p>Thanks to the Java Posse for continuing to spread the word about Grails and Groovy.&nbsp;</p> <p>If you&#39;re not familiar with the Java Posse, I highly recommend that you check out the podcast.&nbsp; The newscasts provide a great way to stay up-to-date, and the interviews offer insightful access to the industry experts behind the news.</p> <ul> 	<li><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/dickwall/JavaPosse080.mp3">Listen</a> to Episode 80.</li> 	<li><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=81157308&amp;s=143441">Subscribe</a> to the Java Posse in iTunes.</li> 	<li><a href="http://media.libsyn.com/media/dickwall/JavaPosse050.mp3">Listen</a>  to the Java Posse&#39;s in-depth interview with Grails project lead <a href="http://graemerocher.blogspot.com/">Graeme Rocher</a>  in <a href="http://www.javaposse.com/index.php?post_id=85020">Episode 50</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li> </ul><br /> <p><br /> <br /> </p>
