<p><a href="http://www.flavor.de/snipsnap/space/start">Sven Haiges</a> is at <a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2006/08/14/grails-podcast-discusses-legacy-db-support/">it</a>  again.&nbsp; This time, he&#39;s created a <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/download/attachments/62352/grails_scaffolding.mov?version=1">screencast</a>  in which he builds a simple Grails application from scratch in less time than it takes to brew a cup o&#39; Joe. Sven, who&#39;s also the voice behind the weekly Grails <a href="http://jasonrudolph.com/blog/2006/08/14/grails-podcast-discusses-legacy-db-support/">podcast</a>, hopes to add more <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GRAILS/Grails+Screencasts">screencasts</a>  in the coming weeks.&nbsp; This first screencast is an excellent showcase of the productivity one can have with Grails, and it&#39;s just the kind of marketing that Groovy and Grails need.&nbsp; One of the key factors in the success of Ruby on Rails is, without a doubt, the marketing genius of David Heinemeier Hansson.&nbsp; (That&#39;s not to say that Rails is anything short of revolutionary, but even a great product needs good marketing if it&#39;s to have any chance of significant adoption.)&nbsp;  It&#39;s great to see Grails begin to develop some similar collateral.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br />
