<p>I recently had the opportunity to chat with Sven Haiges for an <a href="http://hansamann.podspot.de/files/grails_podcast_episode_17.mp3">episode</a> of the Grails podcast.  We discussed the many new features (and impressive number of bug fixes) in the recent <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/GRAILS/2006/11/09/Grails+0.3+Released">0.3 release</a> as well as several of the <a href="http://www.grails.org/Roadmap">upcoming improvements</a> slated for 0.4 and 0.5.  We also talked about the overall increasing momentum of Grails, and Sven recapped last week&#39;s <a href="http://jax.de/">W-JAX 2006</a> conference, which attracted <em>standing-room-only</em> crowds for the Groovy and Grails sessions!  It was a good time, and if you listen closely, you might even catch an announcement of an upcoming Grails-related publication.</p> <p>Many thanks to <a href="http://www.svenhaiges.de">Sven</a>   for having me on the podcast.</p> <p>--</p> <p><a href="/resources/200611172119.jpg"><img src="/resources/200611172119-tm.jpg" width="69" height="15" align="bottom" /></a></p> <p><a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=177436087">Subscribe to the podcast in iTunes</a></p>
