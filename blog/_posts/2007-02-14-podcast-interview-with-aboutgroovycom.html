<p>I recently had the chance to sit down with <a href="http://davisworld.org/">Scott Davis</a>, Editor in Chief of <a href="http://aboutgroovy.com/item/show/83">aboutGroovy.com</a>, for an interview about Grails, how I got involved with it, and what lies ahead.&nbsp; It runs about 23 minutes in length, but we manage to cover quite a bit in that time frame.&nbsp; We agree that we don&#39;t need one programming language/technology &quot;to rule them all.&quot;&nbsp; We discuss the origin of (and the potential future for) <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Getting-Started-Grails-Jason-Rudolph/dp/143030782X">Getting Started with Grails</a>, and we set the record straight on <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/grails-ejb-tutorial#view_2237">whether EJB3 is a legacy technology</a>.&nbsp; (Spoiler alert: It&#39;s not.)</p> <p>Proper RSS support is coming soon for aboutGroovy.com podcasts.&nbsp; In the meantime, feel free to <a href="http://aboutgroovy.com/podcast/JasonRudolph.mp3">download the MP3</a>  directly. &nbsp;</p> <p>Many thanks to Scott and aboutGroovy.com for the interview.&nbsp;</p>
