## Page vi (Foreword)

The second sentence begins with, "You may have to muddle though XML configuration files..."
  
It should instead read, "You may have to muddle <em>through</em> XML configuration files..."

Thanks to Roman Zechner for sending in this correction.

## Page 56 (Chapter 5 - Get Dynamic)

The third paragraph reads, "...we can use the `create.gsp` template as a good staring point."

I suppose you could stare at it if you like, but it should instead read, "...we can use the `create.gsp` template as a good *starting* point."

Thanks to <a href="http://splab.blogspot.com">Darryl Pentz</a> for sending in this correction.

## Page 97 (Chapter 7 - Putting It to the Test)

The second paragraph reads, "And, just as important as making sure we get errors for valid data, we also want to make sure we don't get any errors for a fully-valid Race object."

It should instead read, "And, just as important as making sure we get errors for *invalid* data, we also want to make sure we don't get any errors for a fully-valid Race object."
